Today, [WebK](https://web.telegram.org/k) introduces a redesigned **Emoji and Sticker Panel** – try the **collapsible section** for default emoji categories and the **scrollable bar** for your custom emoji sets.

The new Panel features a beautiful blur effect on most desktop browsers and allows you to **send** or **edit** messages containing custom emoji. __(All users can try out this feature in their Saved Messages)__ 

In the Stickers tab, you can now add or remove stickers from favorites, **send without sound** or individually delete them from the __Recents__ section. 

**Preview Stickers and Emoji**
You can now get a closer look at stickers and emoji, both in the panel and in chats. Click and hold, then hover your cursor over the one you'd like to see in better detail.

Stickers are now rendered more efficiently, using fewer resources and **saving battery**. Custom Emoji have also had more improvements since their launch in [late August](https://t.me/WebK_en/7).

**Downloading Files**
The download flow has been reworked from scratch. When you download something, the app uses your connection in the **most efficient** way possible. Premium users will notice how dramatically fast the app downloads files for them – a little demo is available [here](https://t.me/WebK_en/7?comment=531).

Large files of **up to 4 GB** are now supported for both upload and download. There is also support for native downloading in certain browsers – your browser will place active downloads on the instrument bar. 

**Payments 2.0**
Significant optimizations were added to smoothly process payments in **any browser**, and adding familiar functionality from other Telegram apps. Bot payments, @donate invoices and more are supported – including the ability to subscribe to Telegram Premium with @PremiumBot.

Dozens of bug fixes were also made to the app – but those can be a bit boring to read. If you ever come across a bug in the app, make sure to let us know on the [Bugs and Suggestions Platform](https://bugs.telegram.org/?tag_ids=40&type=issues&sort=time).
