1Ô∏è‚É£ Introducing support for **Multiple Tabs** ‚Äì a first for Telegram Web Apps ‚Äì customizing how you browse Telegram to increase comfort and productivity.
 
‚Ä¢ Open several tabs or browser windows to view multiple chats or channels simultaneously.
‚Ä¢ Organize your Telegram workflow on multiple monitors by moving tabs to different screens.
‚Ä¢ Use `‚åò/Ctrl + click` or `middle-click` on any conversation in your chat list to open it in a separate tab.
 
All messages and content are seamlessly synced across the tabs. To use multiple tabs on Safari, kindly consider switching to another browser for the best experience. Due to Safari‚Äôs [technical limitations](https://t.me/WebK_en/5), the WebK app can still only be used there in a single tab.
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ WebK gets even more stylish, adding:
 
‚Ä¢ Animated placeholders when loading the chat list.
‚Ä¢ Scrolling profile pictures in groups that move up and down with their messages.
‚Ä¢ Menu redesigns with beautiful new blur effects.
‚Ä¢ Colored reply previews that match the color of your chat partners' names. 
 
This update also includes several bug fixes, removing issues with:
- Incorrect unread values
- Visual errors in placeholders
- Failing to mark messages as read
- Performance drops when returning to previous chats.
- and many more üõ†
